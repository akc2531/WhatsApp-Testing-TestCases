### Positive Performance and Load Testing

#### Test Case: Performance Under Normal Load
- **Description:** Evaluate the performance of the WhatsApp application under normal operating conditions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the WhatsApp application on a mobile device.
  2. Perform common tasks such as sending messages, making calls, and updating status.
  3. Measure the response time for each action and overall application responsiveness.
- **Expected Result:** The WhatsApp application responds promptly to user actions, with minimal latency or delays, under normal load conditions.

#### Test Case: Load Handling Capacity
- **Description:** Assess the WhatsApp application's ability to handle a moderate load of user interactions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Simulate a moderate load scenario by generating concurrent messages, calls, and status updates.
  2. Monitor the application's performance and resource utilization.
- **Expected Result:** The WhatsApp application maintains stable performance and responsiveness, with no significant degradation in user experience, under moderate load conditions.

#### Test Case: Scalability Testing
- **Description:** Verify that the WhatsApp application can scale to accommodate an increasing number of users and interactions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Gradually increase the number of concurrent users or interactions within the application.
  2. Monitor system resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
- **Expected Result:** The WhatsApp application scales efficiently to handle a growing user base and workload, with no significant impact on performance or stability.

#### Test Case: Stress Testing
- **Description:** Evaluate the WhatsApp application's resilience and stability under stress conditions.
- **Steps:**
  1. Generate a high load scenario by simulating a large volume of concurrent user interactions.
  2. Monitor system performance and resource utilization during the stress test.
- **Expected Result:** The WhatsApp application remains stable and responsive, with no critical failures or system crashes, even under extreme stress conditions.

#### Test Case: Endurance Testing
- **Description:** Verify that the WhatsApp application can sustain continuous operation over an extended period.
- **Steps:**
  1. Run the WhatsApp application continuously for an extended duration, simulating real-world usage patterns.
  2. Monitor system performance and resource usage over time.
- **Expected Result:** The WhatsApp application operates reliably without performance degradation or stability issues during prolonged usage.
